# Sringboot-Maven-CRUD
In this repository, i used Springboot and Maven to create a CRUD

First, you need create a database called "todo" in your mysql. After, you can start your application openning cmd and writting "mvn spring-boot:run" or running your java application in your eclipse.

When you open your localhost, you will see all records in your database.

You can test the entire CRUD with google chrome extension "postman".

Entering a post method, it is created in the database a record.
